According to earlier reporting, Melvin ended January with $8B in assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMelvin was worth $22.6B in their 13F filing on 12/31 back when the share price was $20.  $22.6B-$16.8B= $5.8B. Add the $2.75B bailout that they received from Citadel, and you wind up with $8.5B in assets at the end of January, which roughly checks out with the CNN reporting. So I believe that CNBC's info is genuine.  They go on to speculate about whether or not Gabe Plotkin effectively now works for Citadel due to the terms of the bailout (or what I like to call Citadelvin now that the two are so intertwined). They're not talking about Vlad working for Citadel, (I think  Cramer was confused, what else is new) so put away your torches and pitchforks, for now...\n\nWhat's interesting is that they say that the loss has since \"come down from there\", and then they received the bailout to \"keep going\".  Remember when Gabe Plotkin called up CNBC in the wee morning hours and claimed to have covered their positions back when price was in the low hundreds before the first squeeze? Up until that point, that was an ATH, so then how did that loss come down if they had exited GME?  Either they told the truth about closing their shorts or covering with synthetic longs and then re-initiated a net short position later to try and make some back on the decline of the first squeeze, or they were lying about covering their original GME positions at all and that $16.8B loss amount was at the peak of the squeeze and was mitigated as the price came back down. If the former is true, then it means that Citadelvin decided that it was time to take their medicine and get out when the price was in the hundreds, and then a couple days later decided it was a good idea to try to time the peak of the squeeze perfectly at $400 to reinitiate shorts and make some money back.   Maybe that happened and Citadelvin have since exited when GME came back down to the $40 range, maybe the price action we're seeing now is due to Citadelvin finally exiting their net short position, maybe Citadelvin still has a net short position and are in big doo-doo. No matter what, this info that Melvin has recouped some of their losses suggests that the chances are high that Citadelvin maintained a significant net short position into February and may still have a net short position.",

New enough to easily be accused of being a bot, or a shill, but I look forward to earning my place here, and your trust, in due time.\n\n(Sorry if I used the wrong flair.)\n\nI started trading last year as a bit of a pandemic hobby, and because my girlfriend had gotten me into it. It was something fun that we could do together and I was excited to learn, since she had about a year's more experience, and a Master's degree in finance. The only hiccup is that she's a lot more risk-averse than I am, so our trading strategies didn't often align.\n\nI've never had much money, and literally lived in a car (or Jeep) for most of my adult life, and will probably go back to doing that once the pandemic is over and being a drifter is more feasible again. (I travel for work, so I was always employed.) I usually described my life like a monk without a religion, just going from place to place wherever I thought I could do the most good. (Though, to be fair, I usually claim my religion as Jedi, because I'm a nerd.) Any money I made, I typically gave it away. I've spent years doing work with causes ranging from children's hospitals to veterans issues to LGBTQ+ and equality concerns. My main interest in life has always been helping people, and my primary financial daydream has always been about funding charities, giving money away to people who need it, and figuring out ways to funnel my wealth into causes worth supporting. \n\nI've managed to turn $2,000 into roughly $12,000 over the past year, and then fell in with you Apes at the end of January, like so many others did. I YOLO'd into AMC and GME because, like so many of you, I dove in with the mindset of, \"I've been poor forever. I can go back to being even poor-er.\"\n\nIt's been so genuinely exciting to be around people with whom I share a risk-loving mentality, where I see so many willing to dive right in, knowing full well that we could lose it all, or gain so incredibly much. It was especially heartwarming to see how many of you took those first GME tendies and turned right around to give to children's hospitals, or other important causes. That's when I knew I'd found my people. Right now, I've got everything in GME and AMC, and I might lose it all, but that's no worries. If it goes well, though, then this money could go to do a world of good, and I owe that possibility to each and every one of you.  \n\n\n**TL;DR: I'm grateful to be here, excited to get to know you, and very hopeful that I can continue to learn lessons (either good or bad) from probably the most hilarious investors I've ever seen in any casino in order to put some good in the world. Cheers to you all, and thank you.**  \n\n\nPositions: GME (7 @ $86.54) AMC (602 @ $17.47)\n\n  \n*I don't know how to do emojis on my laptop, so pardon the lack of rockets and diamond hands.

Last earnings it recorded not only personal records but sectors records yet the price hardly moved at all - in fact dropping a couple of percent. \n\nRkt is strong financially, PE ratios of between 5 and 10 expected for the coming years with these slowly being upgraded.\n\nWhat we’re all interested in here, however, is fast money. So what’s the short interest? The answer - around 40% short interest. Very similar to that of the reddit stocks zooming today.\n\nNow I could talk about mortgage rates staying low, growth potential etc etc but that’s not why I think this stock could boom soon.\n\nYoutube Rocket companies CEO on the stocks Friday surge: in this video the CEO states: “this is not a stock you want to be short in”\n\n(No link to avoid spam filter)\n\nEarnings are today and there is a good chance of some fatal blows to the shorters. Be it the announcement of a dividend, blowout earnings, a new partnership or whatever other news is expected this year from the company. This management doesn’t like shorts and that gives me a feeling that they’re going to be out for blood.\n\nA 40% short interest with 3 days to cover would give an insane rise. I would anticipate 75%+ to mid 30s or even higher. This wouldn’t even place the PE ratio out of bounds of normal industry standards so perhaps we could look at a triple in best case scenarios. This is important as if shorters don’t think the short will come down - especially if they have to pay a dividend - then a short squeeze is more likely. Rkt also has a very small available float. \n\nEarnings are announced post-market today.

      "title": "Game Theory 101: why WSB will lose its tendies trying to squeeze stuff. Discussion",
      "body": "🚀 GAMESTOP TO $130,000. SEE YOU IN THE KUIPER BELT!\n\n**Alright, listen up** **you damn dirty apes**\\*\\*. I'm going to walk you through why these attempted short squeezes are just a recipe to get your faces ripped off. I'm going to use bold on the important stuff so you'll read it before you see a banana or something shiny.\\*\\*\n\nThis monkey troop is an un-coordinated mess. To channel Henry Kissinger, “Who do I call if I want to speak to [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/)?” That's good for legal compliance, but let me explain to you why it will also prevent you from turning your memes into dreams.\n\n**1)** **The Prisoners' Dilemma** is a game theory classic. There are two prisoners who allegedly committed a crime together. If both prisoners snitch on each other, they'll both go to jail for a medium amount of time. If both prisoners keep quiet, it will be hard to prove they did anything wrong and they'll only go to jail for a little while. If one prisoner snitches but the other prisoner stays quiet, the prisoner who didn't snitch gets the book thrown at them and goes to jail for a long, long time.\n\nThis is the position the WSB diamond hands gang is in. If none of you sell, the stock moons. If all of you sell, the stock gets nuked. If some apes sell and other apes don't, the ones who sell make money and the ones who don't get caca shoved down their throats. **Each monkey on WSB has a strong incentive to have hands that are just a little bit less diamond than all the other monkeys' hands.**\n\n**2) Recursion. Let us assume for a moment that every monkey in this troop decides that GME really is going to $1,000.** **Every monkey thinks that when GME hits $1k, all the other monkeys will sell and then the price will crash.**\n\n**Smart monkeys will see the $1,000 top coming.** **They'll use their prehensile tails to enter sell orders at $999.** But then they'll realize that other monkeys will probably do the same thing, meaning GME's peak will really be at **$999**. So monkeys get a little smarter, and enter a sell order at **$998.** But now GME's only going to peak at $998, so monkeys enter sell orders for **$997. The same logic leads us to sell orders at $996, then $995, then $994, and all the way down to a more reasonable valuation.** The squeeze never gets squoze.\n\n**3) Why was Volkswagen different?** You've heard breathless accounts of how the VW shorts called up Porsche crying and begging for relief. Don't wait for Melvin to call all 4 million of us begging for a deal. Porsche bought up a huge chunk of VW stock. Porsche was the only prisoner; it wasn't going to snitch on itself. Porsche didn't have a recursion problem. **Porsche was an 800-pound gorilla. Porsche didn't have to keep an entire troop of howling monkeys in line to squeeze the shorts.**\n\n**TL;DR: 80 10-pound monkeys can't squeeze as hard as one 800-pound gorilla.**\n\nDisclaimer 4 modz: Just saying that WSB is at a structural disadvantage when short squeezing, not that WSB should coordinate more. Yes, this is a repost because my previous versions had a sick YouTube video embedded that automod hated.",

To channel Henry Kissinger, “Who do I call if I want to speak to <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/\">r/WallStreetBets</a>?” That&#39;s good for legal compliance, but let me explain to you why it will also prevent you from turning your memes into dreams.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>The Prisoners&#39; Dilemma</strong> is a game theory classic. There are two prisoners who allegedly committed a crime together. If both prisoners snitch on each other, they&#39;ll both go to jail for a medium amount of time. If both prisoners keep quiet, it will be hard to prove they did anything wrong and they&#39;ll only go to jail for a little while. If one prisoner snitches but the other prisoner stays quiet, the prisoner who didn&#39;t snitch gets the book thrown at them and goes to jail for a long, long time.</p>\n\n<p>This is the position the WSB diamond hands gang is in. If none of you sell, the stock moons. If all of you sell, the stock gets nuked. If some apes sell and other apes don&#39;t, the ones who sell make money and the ones who don&#39;t get caca shoved down their throats. <strong>Each monkey on WSB has a strong incentive to have hands that are just a little bit less diamond than all the other monkeys&#39; hands.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Recursion. Let us assume for a moment that every monkey in this troop decides that GME really is going to $1,000.</strong> <strong>Every monkey thinks that when GME hits $1k, all the other monkeys will sell and then the price will crash.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Smart monkeys will see the $1,000 top coming.</strong> <strong>They&#39;ll use their prehensile tails to enter sell orders at $999.</strong> But then they&#39;ll realize that other monkeys will probably do the same thing, meaning GME&#39;s peak will really be at <strong>$999</strong>. So monkeys get a little smarter, and enter a sell order at <strong>$998.</strong> But now GME&#39;s only going to peak at $998, so monkeys enter sell orders for <strong>$997. The same logic leads us to sell orders at $996, then $995, then $994, and all the way down to a more reasonable valuation.</strong> The squeeze never gets squoze.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3) Why was Volkswagen different?</strong> You&#39;ve heard breathless accounts of how the VW shorts called up Porsche crying and begging for relief. Don&#39;t wait for Melvin to call all 4 million of us begging for a deal. Porsche bought up a huge chunk of VW stock. Porsche was the only prisoner; it wasn&#39;t going to snitch on itself. Porsche didn&#39;t have a recursion problem. <strong>Porsche was an 800-pound gorilla. Porsche didn&#39;t have to keep an entire troop of howling monkeys in line to squeeze the shorts.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR: 80 10-pound monkeys can&#39;t squeeze as hard as one 800-pound gorilla.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer 4 modz: Just saying that WSB is at a structural disadvantage when short squeezing, not that WSB should coordinate more. Yes, this is a repost because my previous versions had a sick YouTube video embedded that automod hated.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
